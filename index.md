|:--------------------|:-------------------|:-------------------|:-------------------|
| Weigh over 35lbs on average | Priced per visit | Difficult to push in mushy/elevated terrains | Extremely expensive |
| Heavy strain on the shoulders| Golfers still need to carry golf bag on each hole | Tiring to push for multiple hours | Tedious to control |
| Requires over 175lbs bodyweight to safely carry | Many golfers prefer to walk the golf course | Cannot be easily placed on elevated terrains | Complicated to use/learning curve |
